## On-the-fly Config Demo
This create a page with header, table and footer. 
You can modify the table in the browser by clicking the configure icon (top right).

The code is more complex, because all required REST/JSON web services are implemented.

Implemented API is:
* GET /products
** get list of products
* POST /products
** save/update a product record (you can edit it in the table)
* GET /products/pong-table
** load table view configuration
* GET /products/pong-easytable
** load table view configuration
* GET /products/pong-easytable/columns-available
** load a configuration template
* POST /products/pong-easytable
** save table view configuration
